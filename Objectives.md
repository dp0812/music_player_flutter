## Objectives
This project is aimed to make an mp3 player app, which is relatively simple and intuitive to use, and, here are goals of the app:
- There MUST NOT be any ads. No ads, not a single chance. 
- The music app MUST be able to run in the background - that is, even if the phone screen is off, it must be able to continue playing music. 
- The music app should be able to let user add MP3 files on the device to the app, if granted permissions. 
- The music app should be able to let user rewind the song, create playlist, loop the playlist, loop a specific song, or random song order in the playlist.
- Playlist should be able to be customized (as in, set a playlist picture and rename)
 
## Progress
- Dec 1st: Framework
- Dec 19th: Basic functionality online: 
    - Create/delete playlist; add/delete songs.
    - Previous and next song, play-pause-resume, 
    - Loop playlist
    - Some nicer looking UI (inspired by Ubuntu Gnome style, to a certain extent).
