# music_player

This project is aimed to create a freely distributed mp3 player app, with NO ADS. Read the GNU license file for details of this freedom. 

## Getting Started

Everything is in the lib directory, except for the input MP3.

The location of the directory where the MP3 will be read is based of the result of getApplicationDocumentsDirectory function.
This varies across different os. Please check the terminal output to see where you should place the MP3 file to test. 

This is my second attempt with flutter, so this might not be as good as expected.
