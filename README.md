# MP3 Player

This project is aimed to create a freely distributed mp3 player app (and, also my chance of practicing), with NO ADS. 
Read the GNU license file for details of this freedom. 

## Getting Started

To run this project, make sure you set up Flutter engine, and then clone the project accordingly. 

Everything is in the lib directory, except for the input MP3.

The location of the directory where the info of the MP3 files will be stored is based of the result of getApplicationDocumentsDirectory function.
This varies across different os. Please check the terminal output to see where this file is. 
The program does not store the file - it only stores the access path. 

This is my second attempt with flutter, so this might not be as good as expected.
